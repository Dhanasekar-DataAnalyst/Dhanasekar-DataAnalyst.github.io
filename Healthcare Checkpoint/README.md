# 🏥 Patient Care and Clinical Outcomes Dashboard
### 📊 Overview
  In today’s healthcare landscape, data-driven insights play a crucial role in improving patient outcomes and enhancing operational efficiency. This dashboard offers a comprehensive view of clinical care using data from over 6,900 patients, focusing on metrics like demographics, diagnostic results, treatment durations, medication usage, and healthcare expenditures.

  By visualizing trends in age, gender, blood type, chronic conditions, and insurance coverage, the dashboard supports healthcare professionals and analysts in making evidence-based decisions to optimize patient care and resource allocation.
